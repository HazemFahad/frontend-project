## Node Version:

I used node version v18.0.0 when building this app.

## To Run Repo This Locally:

1. In the terminal change directory to wherever you wanted to clone this folder.

2. In terminal use command:

<code>git clone https://github.com/squarezy/frontend-project</code>

3. Once this has completed open the file with a code editor.

4. Once the code editor has opened - open a terminal inside the code editor and run <code>cd nc-news</code>

5. Run <code>npm install</code> in terminal to install dependencies.

6. Run <code>npm start</code> in terminal to open site locally. If not automatically directed - open a browser and navigate to localhost:3000.

Many Thanks!
